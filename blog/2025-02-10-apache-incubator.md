We are thrilled to announce that **Iggy** has officially joined the **[Apache Incubator](https://incubator.apache.org/)**! This marks a major milestone in our journey to redefine message streaming â€” one that is **blazingly fast, hyper-efficient, and built for the future**. Since the very first day, **Iggy was always meant to be a truly FOSS project** â€” not just open-source in name, but deeply rooted in the values of transparency, collaboration, and community-driven innovation.

## ðŸš€ A Journey Two Years in the Making
Itâ€™s been almost two years since the very first line of code was written, and weâ€™ve come a long way since the initial release. What started as a bold idea has grown into a high-performance, cost-efficient message streaming solution with a thriving community of contributors, users, and advocates. Weâ€™ve received invaluable feedback, contributions, and support, and weâ€™re more excited than ever to take Iggy to the next level.


## ðŸ”¥ Beyond Just Iggy â€“ A Growing Ecosystem
Iggy is no longer just about the core repository. Over time, weâ€™ve built an entire ecosystem around it, including:

- âœ… SDKs for seamless developer integrations
- âœ… CLIs for powerful command-line control
- âœ… Web UIs for intuitive management
- âœ… And many moreâ€¦

Weâ€™re already approaching 20 repositories under the Iggy organization ([see them here](https://github.com/iggy-rs/)), and as we enter the Apache Incubator, we are committed to ensuring that all of them follow ASF guidelines while maintaining our core values of speed, efficiency, and simplicity.

## ðŸ”— Why Apache?

The Apache Software Foundation has nurtured some of the **most transformative open-source projects in history** â€” Hadoop, Spark, Lucene, Solr, Cassandra, Kafka, Flink, and Airflow â€” technologies that have **shaped big data, search, and real-time processing**. By joining Apache Incubator, we align with this legacy and **gain access to a larger community, better governance, and long-term sustainability**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Whatâ€™s Next?
**Our vision is clear: Iggy as a future Apache Top-Level Project (TLP)**. We already have ambitious ideas on how to improve both the project and the community around it:

- **Scaling performance benchmarks** to push the limits of ultra-low-latency streaming
- **Expanding integrations** with modern data infrastructure
- **Building a vibrant developer ecosystem** that makes message streaming frictionless

## ðŸ¦€ Codebase transition

After the recent [discussion](https://lists.apache.org/thread/zrn96nlg23r9353lr5tp2by2ggx4zxqc), we plan to stick to the **monorepo approach**, under which, we will have a single repository for all the Iggy-related projects. This will make it easier for the contributors to navigate through the codebase, and to see how the changes in one project affect the others. This should also help us to keep the consistency across the projects, especially, once we release the Rust bindings to be used within the other languages SDKs.

All the repositories under [iggy-rs](https://github.com/iggy-rs) will be eventually moved to the [apache/iggy](https://github.com/apache/iggy) repository, and we will make sure that all the existing links and references are updated accordingly.

We'll also host our website under the [iggy.apache.org](https://iggy.apache.org) domain, including the documentation, blog, and the upcoming benchmarks. We've also updated our social media handles to contain the Apache prefix.

There will be most likely some changes related to hosting the Docker images, as well as the other tools we're using, but we'll make sure to keep you updated on that.

## ðŸ’¡ Join the Movement
If you believe in a future where message streaming is lightning-fast, hyper-efficient, and accessible to all, we invite you to be part of this journey. Whether you're a developer, architect, or enterprise innovator, your contributions, feedback, and ideas will shape what comes next.

And this is just the beginning. **Welcome to the era of Hyper-Efficient Message Streaming at Laser Speed.**

**Last but not least, we've got a new logo**! Our lovely Italian Greyhound is now a part of the Apache family, and we're proud to have it as our mascot. As you can see, it's so fast, that even the light travelling through the optical fiber can't keep up with it :)
