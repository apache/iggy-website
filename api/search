Each core (shard), runs it's own instance of the server, which means that there is (almost) no shared state between the cores. This allows Iggy to scale linearly with the number of cores, as there is no contention between the cores. This architecture been proven by systems such as redpanda or scylladb, which are known for their high performance and low latency. Each shard owns an subset of partitions (units of parallelism in message streaming systems), and is responsible for handling all the I/O operations for those partitions.
