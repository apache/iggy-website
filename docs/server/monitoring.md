# Monitoring

> Scrape the server's Prometheus metrics: the token the endpoint needs, what it exports, and which metrics are worth alerting on.

Rendered page: https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/monitoring/

Docs version: server 0.10.0, Rust SDK 0.12.0, CLI 0.15.0, Node.js SDK 0.11.0, Python, Java, Go and C# SDKs 0.10.0, Swift, C++ and PHP SDKs 0.2.0

The server exports Prometheus metrics on its HTTP API at `/metrics`. Both the HTTP API and the metrics endpoint are on by default. See [`[http.metrics]`](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/configuration#httpmetrics) to change the path or turn it off.

This page covers the server's own metrics. The connectors runtime has a separate endpoint with its own metric names. See [Connectors observability](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/connectors/observability).

## Get a token for the scraper

`/metrics` needs a bearer token, like every other read on the HTTP API. Any logged-in user can scrape it and gets the aggregate gauges. The per-topic series need the `read_servers` or `manage_servers` permission. There's no separate monitoring permission. Prometheus can't log in, so create a personal access token and put it in the scrape config:

```bash
iggy pat create prometheus 90d
```

The token is printed once. The Prometheus scrape config is in [`[http.metrics]`](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/configuration#httpmetrics).

The token can read every metric the server exports, so store it like any other secret: in a Kubernetes Secret or your secrets manager, not in a file you commit. With the Helm chart, set it through `server.serviceMonitor.authorization`. See [Docker & Helm](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/docker).

## What's exported

The core metrics are below. The gauges are read fresh on every scrape.

| Metric | Type | What it counts |
|--------|------|----------------|
| `http_requests_total` | counter | HTTP API requests |
| `streams`, `topics`, `partitions`, `segments` | gauge | Current number of each |
| `messages` | gauge | Messages stored |
| `users` | gauge | Users |
| `clients` | gauge | Connected clients |

The names have no `iggy_` prefix, so watch for clashes if Prometheus scrapes other exporters with similar names.

Each shard also exports its own lower-level metrics, labelled `shard="<id>"`. These cover the write-ahead log (the `partition_wal_*` series), partition housekeeping (`partitions_*`), and requests or frames the server refused or dropped. To see the full list with descriptions, scrape a running server:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:3000/metrics | grep '^# HELP'
```

## What to alert on

- **`frame_drops_total{variant="forward_client_send"}`.** Any increase means a client never got a reply to a request. Most other `frame_drops_total` variants are retried or repaired automatically. This series only appears after the first drop, so on a healthy server it won't be in the scrape at all. Write the alert so that a missing series counts as no drops.
- **`stats_rollup_underflows_total`.** It goes up when a stream, topic or partition total would have dropped below zero and was held at zero instead. A few during deletes or restores are expected. A steady rise at other times is worth a look.

## Grafana and OpenTelemetry

Add Prometheus as a data source in Grafana, then build panels from the metric names above.

The server doesn't export metrics over OTLP. To bring them into an OpenTelemetry pipeline, scrape `/metrics` with the collector's Prometheus receiver, using the same bearer token. Server export of logs and traces over OTLP isn't available yet. See [`[telemetry]`](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/server/configuration#telemetry).

## Topic usage and replica progress

`topic_size_bytes`, `topic_messages` and `topic_max_size_bytes` use `stream` and `topic` labels. The size-cap series is absent for unlimited topics. Renamed or deleted topics disappear from the next scrape. Retention can keep more bytes than the configured cap, so a usage ratio is not a hard storage boundary.

Replica counters can lag a successful send until a prepare or commit broadcast updates them. Compare node-local observations with routing and view-change events before treating a transient difference as data loss. Repair-ring metrics report retained batch bytes and released-entry accounting, not total process memory.
