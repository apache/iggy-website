# PHP SDK

> The experimental PHP SDK, a native extension wrapping the Rust SDK, and how to build it from source.

Rendered page: https://iggy.apache.org/docs/sdk/php/intro/

Source: https://github.com/apache/iggy-website/blob/main/content/docs/sdk/php/intro.mdx

Docs version: server 0.10.0, Rust SDK 0.12.0, CLI 0.15.0, Node.js SDK 0.11.0, Python, Java, Go and C# SDKs 0.10.0, Swift, C++ and PHP SDKs 0.2.0

The Iggy PHP SDK is a native PHP extension built in Rust with [ext-php-rs](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs). It wraps the Rust SDK and exposes a synchronous `Iggy\Client`: each call drives the extension's internal Tokio runtime and blocks the calling PHP thread until the operation completes. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/server-0.10.0-rc.1/foreign/php).

The extension is experimental. It's defined as the `apache/iggy-php` composer package (`php-ext` type). To use it today, build it from the repository source.

## Requirements

- Rust and Cargo
- PHP 8.3 or newer with `php-config` (non-thread-safe builds only, no ZTS)
- [`cargo-php`](https://github.com/davidcole1340/ext-php-rs)

## Build and install

```bash
cd foreign/php
cargo build --release
cargo php install --release --yes

# Verify PHP can load it
php -r 'var_dump(extension_loaded("iggy-php"));'
```

Alternatively, skip the install and point PHP at the built library per invocation:

```bash
php -d extension=target/release/libiggy_php.so my-script.php
```

On macOS the library is `libiggy_php.dylib`.

## Quick start

The sample below targets Iggy 0.10.0 on `127.0.0.1:8090`. Start the server:

```bash
# Server 0.10.0
docker run --rm \
  --cap-add=SYS_NICE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -e IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8090 \
  -e IGGY_NODE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS=localhost \
  -e IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy -e IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy \
  apache/iggy:0.10.0

# Or from the repository root
cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --fresh --with-default-root-credentials
```

The environment variables make the server reachable through the published port (it binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the container by default) and bootstrap the `iggy`/`iggy` root credentials for a new data directory. Existing stored credentials are not replaced. For the source command, ensure `IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME` and `IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD` are unset or match the sample. Environment values take precedence over the flag. `--fresh` removes the local replica state, so use it only for disposable development data.

For binary transports, credentials in the connection string take effect on `connect()`. HTTP requires `loginUser()` explicitly. Alternatively, construct the client with a plain address (`new \Iggy\Client('127.0.0.1:8090')`) and call `loginUser('iggy', 'iggy')` explicitly.

```php
<?php

use Iggy\Client;
use Iggy\PollingStrategy;
use Iggy\SendMessage;

$client = Client::fromConnectionString('iggy+tcp://iggy:iggy@127.0.0.1:8090');
$client->connect();

$stream = 'php-stream';
$topic = 'php-topic';

// Re-running this example is fine: only create what is missing.
if ($client->getStream($stream) === null) {
    $client->createStream($stream);
}

if ($client->getTopic($stream, $topic) === null) {
    $client->createTopic($stream, $topic, 1);
}

$messages = [];
foreach (range(1, 10) as $i) {
    $messages[] = new SendMessage("message-{$i}");
}
$client->sendMessages($stream, $topic, 0, $messages);

$polled = $client->pollMessages(
    $stream, $topic, 0, 1, PollingStrategy::first(), new \Iggy\PollOptions(count: 10)
);
foreach ($polled->messages as $message) {
    echo "Offset: {$message->offset()}, Payload: {$message->payload()}", PHP_EOL;
}
```

## Consumer groups

`consumerGroup()` creates and joins a group by default. It reads assigned partitions and stores no offsets unless you select a policy or commit checkpoints. This example processes five messages:

```php
<?php

$consumer = $client->consumerGroup(
    'php-consumer', $stream, $topic, \Iggy\PollingStrategy::next(),
);
try {
    $consumer->consumeMessages(
        function (\Iggy\ReceiveMessage $message) use ($consumer): void {
            echo $message->payload(), PHP_EOL;
            $consumer->commit($message->checkpoint());
        },
        5,
    );
} finally {
    $consumer->shutdown();
}
```

`consumeMessages()` requires a finite limit. A callback exception ends the run. With automatic commits after processing, the failed message stays uncounted. `PollOptions` carries the commit policy. Use `CommitPolicy::manual()`, `CommitPolicy::onRead()` or `CommitPolicy::auto(...)`.

`reader()` reads batches from explicit partitions. `groupReader()` reads an existing group's assignment. Close a reader with `close()`. A timeout on `next(timeout_micros)` returns null and keeps a later batch available for the next call.

## API notes

- Methods are camelCase and classes live in the `Iggy` namespace, for example `Iggy\Client` and `Iggy\SendMessage`.
- Partition ids are 0-based: for a topic with one partition, use `0`.
- PHP strings are passed as named identifiers, including strings that contain only digits. PHP integers are passed as numeric identifiers.
- `PollingStrategy::timestamp()` and `timestampMicros()` expect microseconds since the Unix epoch. Use `PollingStrategy::timestampSeconds()` for PHP `time()` values.
- Message IDs and checksums are returned as decimal strings. Offset and timestamp getters return PHP integers and are limited to `PHP_INT_MAX`.
- Errors are thrown as exceptions under `Iggy\Exception`: `AuthenticationException`, `ConnectionException`, `NotFoundException`, `TransientException`, and the `IggyException` base.
- TLS uses the Rust SDK connection-string format, for example `iggy+tcp://user:pass@host:port?tls=true&tls_domain=localhost&tls_ca_file=/path/to/ca.pem`.
- The extension owns a lazy global Tokio runtime. Don't call `pcntl_fork()` after the first Iggy call: the child inherits file descriptors but not the runtime's worker threads.

## Resource options and recovery

`createStream($name, $encryption_key)` accepts the standard padded base64 of a 32-byte stream key. `createTopic` accepts named creation arguments, including `replication_factor`. Stream and topic updates change only named fields and reset keys. `describeOptions()` lists each catalog. User and PAT administration are not exposed as typed PHP methods in this release. Reads expose encryption fingerprints, never key material.

`getMetadataChanges()` follows the metadata log. `sendBinaryRequestToReplica()` sends supported non-replicated commands to a selected node. See [Metadata changes](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/sdk/metadata-changes).

Retained mutation errors expose an operation ID. Use `resolveOperation()` on the same client to retry its retained identity, or `abandonOperation()` to accept the unknown result and release local state. A lost committing poll throws `FetchProgressUncertain` and blocks progress for the partition until abandonment.

## Examples

Working examples are available in the [examples/php](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/server-0.10.0-rc.1/examples/php) directory. They read `IGGY_CONNECTION_STRING` for a binary transport with credentials. Otherwise they connect over TCP using `IGGY_HOST` and `IGGY_PORT`, then log in with the literal `IGGY_USERNAME` and `IGGY_PASSWORD` values:

```bash
# From the repository root
cd examples/php
(cd ../../foreign/php && cargo build)
export PHP_IGGY_EXTENSION="$(pwd)/../../foreign/php/target/debug/libiggy_php.so"

php -d extension="$PHP_IGGY_EXTENSION" getting-started/producer.php
php -d extension="$PHP_IGGY_EXTENSION" getting-started/consumer.php
```
