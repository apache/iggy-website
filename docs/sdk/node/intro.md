# Node.js SDK

> The Node.js and TypeScript SDK, from installation to keeping client and server versions in step.

Rendered page: https://iggy.apache.org/docs/sdk/node/intro/

Source: https://github.com/apache/iggy-website/blob/main/content/docs/sdk/node/intro.mdx

Docs version: server 0.10.0, Rust SDK 0.12.0, CLI 0.15.0, Node.js SDK 0.11.0, Python, Java, Go and C# SDKs 0.10.0, Swift, C++ and PHP SDKs 0.2.0

The Iggy Node.js SDK is a client library that allows you to interact with the Iggy API from your Node.js and TypeScript applications. It communicates with the Iggy server over TCP or TLS using the binary protocol. The package is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-iggy) and the source code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/server-0.10.0/foreign/node).

These docs target server **0.10.0** and Node SDK **0.11.0**. The Node package 0.8.0 uses the older protocol. The current SDK speaks only the VSR wire protocol and doesn't fall back to older formats.

## Installation

```bash
npm install apache-iggy@0.11.0
```

## Quick start

The samples below expect an Iggy server on `127.0.0.1:8090`. See [Getting started](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/introduction/getting-started) for the server prerequisites:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  --cap-add=SYS_NICE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 \
  -p 8090:8090 \
  -e IGGY_TCP_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0:8090 \
  -e IGGY_NODE_ADVERTISED_ADDRESS=localhost \
  -e IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME=iggy -e IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD=iggy \
  apache/iggy:0.10.0

# Or from a 0.10.0 source checkout
cargo run --bin iggy-server -- --fresh --with-default-root-credentials
```

The environment variables make the server reachable through the published port (it binds to `127.0.0.1` inside the container by default) and set the root credentials the samples log in with. Without `--with-default-root-credentials` (or the `IGGY_ROOT_USERNAME` / `IGGY_ROOT_PASSWORD` variables), a fresh server refuses to start. For source runs, `--fresh` deletes existing local server data. Explicit credential environment variables take precedence over the default-root flag. Bootstrap settings do not replace credentials already stored in recovered data.

Save the following snippets as `producer.mjs` and `consumer.mjs` in the project where you installed the SDK. Run `node producer.mjs` before `node consumer.mjs`. A consumer group sample follows them.

### Producer

```typescript
import { Client, Partitioning } from 'apache-iggy';

const STREAM_NAME = 'sample-stream';
const TOPIC_NAME = 'sample-topic';

const client = new Client({
  transport: 'TCP',
  options: { port: 8090, host: '127.0.0.1' },
  credentials: { username: 'iggy', password: 'iggy' },
});

// Re-running this example is fine: only create what is missing.
const streams = await client.stream.list();
const stream =
  streams.find((s) => s.name === STREAM_NAME) ??
  (await client.stream.create({ name: STREAM_NAME }));

const topics = await client.topic.list({ streamId: stream.id });
const topic =
  topics.find((t) => t.name === TOPIC_NAME) ??
  (await client.topic.create({
    streamId: stream.id,
    name: TOPIC_NAME,
    partitionCount: 1,
    compressionAlgorithm: 1, // 1 = None, 2 = Gzip
  }));

const messages = Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => ({
  id: i + 1,
  headers: [],
  payload: `message-${i + 1}`,
}));

await client.message.send({
  streamId: stream.id,
  topicId: topic.id,
  messages,
  partition: Partitioning.Balanced,
});

console.log(`Sent ${messages.length} message(s)`);

await client.destroy();
```

The client resolves the target partition and routes requests to its primary. A primary can differ from the metadata leader.

### Consumer

```typescript
import { Client, CommitPolicy, PollingStrategy, Consumer } from 'apache-iggy';

const STREAM_NAME = 'sample-stream';
const TOPIC_NAME = 'sample-topic';
const PARTITION_ID = 0;

const client = new Client({
  transport: 'TCP',
  options: { port: 8090, host: '127.0.0.1' },
  credentials: { username: 'iggy', password: 'iggy' },
});

// Next starts after consumer 0's stored offset.
// Autocommit requests offset storage before application processing.
const polledMessages = await client.message.poll({
  streamId: STREAM_NAME,
  topicId: TOPIC_NAME,
  consumer: Consumer.Single,
  partitionId: PARTITION_ID,
  strategy: PollingStrategy.Next,
  options: { count: 10, commit: CommitPolicy.OnRead },
});

for (const message of polledMessages.messages) {
  const payload = message.payload.toString('utf8');
  console.log(`Offset: ${message.headers.offset}, Payload: ${payload}`);
}

await client.destroy();
```

The poll response does not wait for the auto-commit to finish. The sample processes messages after polling, so auto-commit does not confirm that the application handled each message.

### Consumer group

A consumer group distributes partitions among its members. The high-level consumer creates and joins the group, then reads its assigned partitions. Save this as `consumer-group.mjs`:

```typescript
import { Client } from 'apache-iggy';

const client = new Client('iggy://iggy:iggy@127.0.0.1:8090');
const consumer = await client.consumerGroup({
  name: 'sample-group',
  streamId: 'sample-stream',
  topicId: 'sample-topic',
});
try {
  for await (const received of consumer) {
    console.log(received.message.payload.toString('utf8'));
    await consumer.commit(received.checkpoint);
  }
} finally {
  await consumer.shutdown();
  await client.destroy();
}
```

This loop waits for messages until it is stopped. It stores checkpoints after printing. The group has its own offsets, separate from a standalone consumer.

### Running the samples again

All three samples can be run again without changes:

- `node producer.mjs` finds the existing stream and topic and appends ten more messages.
- `node consumer.mjs` prints only the new messages, because `PollingStrategy.Next` continues after the stored offset. With nothing new to read, it prints nothing.
- `node consumer-group.mjs` does the same from the group's stored offset.

To start again with an empty server, stop the container and run the `docker run` command again. `--rm` removes the container and its data.

## Configuration

The client constructor accepts a few options:

- **reconnect**: automatic reconnection with `{ enabled, interval, maxRetries }`.
- **heartbeatInterval**: the client pings the server every 5 seconds by default. `0` disables heartbeats. When server heartbeat eviction is enabled, silent consumer-group members can be evicted, so keep it well below the server's heartbeat timeout.
- **maxResponseFrameSize**: response frames larger than this limit (default 64 MiB) are rejected and close the connection. Raise it when polling very large batches.
- **poolSize**: the client currently supports exactly one pooled connection. `min`/`max` above 1 throw.
- **TLS**: set `transport: 'TLS'` and pass Node `tls.ConnectionOptions` in `options`. See the [tcp-tls example](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/server-0.10.0/examples/node/src/tcp-tls).

## Beyond the basics

- **Consumer groups**: `client.group` manages groups (including ensure-and-join in one call), and `client.message.reader` or `client.consumerGroup` reads the assigned partitions. A one-shot poll names one partition.
- **Consumer streams**: A high-level consumer supports async iteration, handler-based consumption and `toReadable()`.
- **Administration**: users, personal access tokens, offsets, partitions, segments, and cluster metadata are all available on the client.
- **Errors**: the package exports `ResponseError`, `DeserializeError`, `ProtocolFrameError`, and `VsrEvictionError` for precise error handling.

## Examples

Examples are available in the [examples/node](https://github.com/apache/iggy/tree/server-0.10.0/examples/node) directory, written in TypeScript. See [Examples](https://iggy.apache.org/docs/sdk/node/examples) for the list and how to run them.
