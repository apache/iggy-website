## Release 0.6.0

Four months after [0.5.0](https://iggy.apache.org/blogs/2025/08/10/release-0.5.0/), we're excited to release **[Apache Iggy 0.6.0](https://github.com/apache/iggy/releases/tag/server-0.6.0)** — our biggest architectural change yet.

This release represents a **major architectural evolution** of Apache Iggy with substantial performance improvements, new connectors, and SDK enhancements.


## Iggy Server

The most significant change in 0.6.0 is the **complete server rewrite** using **[io_uring](https://github.com/apache/iggy/pull/2299)** with a **thread-per-core, shared-nothing architecture**. This represents a fundamental shift from the previous Tokio-based poll model to a completion-based async runtime using [compio](https://github.com/compio-rs/compio).

Key aspects of this architectural change:
- **Completion-based I/O** - unlike poll-based models, **io_uring** uses completion queues where the kernel notifies when operations finish
- **Thread-per-core design** - each CPU core runs its own event loop with dedicated resources, eliminating cross-thread synchronization overhead
- **Shared-nothing model** - data is partitioned across cores to minimize contention and cache invalidation

This delivers improved throughput, lower latency, and more predictable tail latencies (p99+) under load.

### WebSocket Transport

Along with the io_uring migration, we've decided to implement **WebSocket transport** as a first-class communication protocol alongside TCP, QUIC and HTTP. This enables seamless integration with web clients and environments where WebSocket is preferred. Since existing libraries are poll-based and incompatible with compio's completion model, the solution was **[compio-ws](https://iggy.apache.org/blogs/2025/11/17/websocket-io-uring)**, designed from the ground up for completion-based I/O.

### Breaking Changes

- **Argon2** - the default password hashing algorithm is no longer using **bcrypt** but **Argon2id** for improved security and performance
- **xxHash3 replaces CRC32** - message checksums now use **xxHash3** (64 bits), and **UUIDv4** is used for random message IDs
- **Cluster configuration restructured** - `ClusterNode` now uses `TransportEndpoints` for multi-protocol communication
- **Auto-generated root password** - default root password is now auto-generated if not provided

Docker images are available on **[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/apache?page=1&search=iggy)**.

## SDKs

All SDKs received significant updates:

- [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/iggy) - builder pattern for client, unified TransportProtocol enum, cluster metadata support
- [C#](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Apache.Iggy/) - high-level IggyPublisher/IggyConsumer clients, TCP reconnection, TLS support, AES encryption
- [Java](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.iggy/iggy-java-sdk) - complete async API using Netty with CompletableFutures, TLS TCP support, fixed memory leak for sync client
- [Python](https://pypi.org/project/apache-iggy/) - connection string support, bytes data, typing stubs, musllinux wheels
- [Node.js (TypeScript)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apache-iggy) - virtual commands (ensureStream, ensureTopic), cluster metadata, added examples
- [Go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/apache/iggy/foreign/go) - DeleteConsumerOffset, improved error handling and deserialization

## Connectors

New connectors expand integration options:

- **[Iceberg sink](https://github.com/apache/iggy/pull/2191)** - S3-compatible storage, REST catalogs, single destination table, and multiple-table fan-out
- **[Elasticsearch sink and source](https://github.com/apache/iggy/pull/1872)** - Full Elasticsearch integration with rustls TLS support
- **[Flink processor](https://github.com/apache/iggy/pull/2300)** - Stream processing integration with Apache Flink

The connectors runtime also gained an extensible configuration provider system, HTTP-based config provider, TCP TLS support, and a comprehensive E2E test suite.

## Clustering (Work in Progress)

Foundation for clustering is being laid:

- **GetClusterMetadata command** - retrieve cluster topology and node status
- **Leader-aware connect** - SDKs can detect and connect to cluster leader
- **TransportEndpoints** - multi-protocol cluster communication (TCP, QUIC, HTTP, WebSocket)
- **Consensus and metadata modules** - foundation for cluster consensus

---

## Web UI

- Autocomplete functionality
- Fixed large number (u64/u128) rendering
- Enhanced keyboard navigation
- Security improvements (removed password persistence)
- Fixed create stream/topic commands

---

## Helm Charts

Server and UI combined into a **[unified Helm chart](https://github.com/apache/iggy/pull/2185)** with environment variable support and improved Kubernetes compatibility.

---

## What's Next

Our primary focus is **clustering with [Viewstamped Replication (VSR)](https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/vr-revisited.pdf)** consensus protocol. This will enable fault-tolerant, replicated deployments — a critical milestone for production workloads requiring high availability and reliability.

Other upcoming efforts:
- Server's core optimizataions such as kTLS, DirectIO, NUMA, TCP connections transfer across shards and more
- Expanding SDKs with synchronous clients and [sans-io](https://www.firezone.dev/blog/sans-io) design
- Enhancing the Connectors Runtime with more integrations
- Exploring **Agentic AI** use cases for streaming-based agent coordination
- Web UI improvements
